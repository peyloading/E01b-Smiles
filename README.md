I used a bunch of random shapes and formed them into smiley faces by changing the x and y values, and also adjusting heights and widths. In thew first file, I just tampered with the values of everything. In the second part, I had established that the yellow circle and outlined black circle were merged together to make one "face". Then I could just move the entire face and all it's parts to the middle. Then I had to discover the offsets for each aspect of the face. In the fourth step it was basically the same thing, but the face shape was turned into a pattern all over the screen.
